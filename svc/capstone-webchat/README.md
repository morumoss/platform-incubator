## Description

This is a capstone research project in progress.

## Requirements

You will need to install `docker` and `docker-compose` to leverage the tooling.

## Development

To contribute to the code base, your editor will likely require you to run `dotnet restore` to generate `obj` and `bin` artifacts.

## Getting Started

Navigate to the root of the project directory. You can run the following commands to get a working environment going.

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

You can run `docker-compose down` to close it gracefully. Otherwise, `CTRL+C` will suffice if you're still running the `up` command in terminal.
